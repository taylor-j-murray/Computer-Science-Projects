# Dimension and Axes of numpy Arrays

## What is a numpy Array

The numpy object numpy.array is similar to an array object in the native python language with two exceptions
1. A numpy.array must be homogenous, meaning that the type of all elements of the array must be the same.
2. A numpy.array stores the data in the array much more efficiently than its native python counterpart. 

One way in which we can create a numpy.array is by feeding in an array-like object e.g a python list or python array into the function 
numpy.array(). For example

```python
import numpy as np
A = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6]]
print(A)
#output: 
```
